# af_csv_to_json
Rest API that takes csv data stream and returns JSON list



As a developer, you can always bring in a module or an external sdk into the context of the AZ Function. Make sure your 
package .json file is updated. Using this 
technique, you can use an csv package available as open source in the market.
Remember, nodejs is asynchronous so the convert method in xformbroker module is declared as async and the actual calls
 are in await mode. I am also using callback technique. This will make it multithread complaint on heavy loads!!
